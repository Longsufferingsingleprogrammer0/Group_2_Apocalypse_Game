to do:
create project
learn listed things
set up School GitHub account
set up GitHub repo for project
get correct gitignore files


art asset notes:
everything is in tiles of 32 by 32.
player is 32 by 40
wide shelves are 64 by 48
small shelves are 32 by 48
collectables are 8 by 8

gameplay:
go around a map collecting items, and fighting enemies. items and enemies randomly placed in map, grid based map, 


programming notes{
//for random placement, can probably use nested arrays, place items ids in array randomly, then spawn, this prevents accidental double placing

maps are partially randomly generated, base map is fixed with specific areas that are randomly generated, and collectables randomly generated on those

enemies are randomly placed on a grid throughout the map, with certain areas off limits

possibly use a gamemaster object to handle spawning and map gen, as well as keep track of variables for these (number, spawn areas, etc.)

maps are just big pictures, with objects placed in designated areas on top of them

shelf collision should just be a line at the top. it makes sense trust me

objects in game should be prefabs (furniture, collectables, enemies. 

figure out attack system

need scene system
}


to learn{
scene management
prefabs
simple ai
attacks
collisions
camera movement
inputs
keeping tract of lists of coordinates
gamemaster object for map generator
}



Things we must have for 1st version:
a single map 
collision
movement
1 Character
1-2 types of enemies - and animation?
one collectable just to start
health system
one attack
a basic enemy ai system(several options: pathing to player, random movement, predetermined paths, etc)//not priority 
random collectable placing
